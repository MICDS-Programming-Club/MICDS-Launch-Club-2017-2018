<p>
	<strong>Hey {{firstName}} {{lastName}}, welcome to the MICDS MIT Launch Club!</strong>
	We've got big things planned for this year, so we're glad you're interested!
</p>

<h1>Meeting</h1>
<p>MICDS MIT Launch Club will usually meet during collaborative and 8am on Wednesday late starts. Make an effort to attend every meeting, but the extra meeting Wednesday morning is there for people who have to meet with teachers during collaborative.</p>

<h1>Collaboration</h1>

<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>We will mainly use a messaging platform called Slack to communicate with each other outside of school. <strong>Check your inbox for another email for an invite to our Slack team.</strong> It is important that you accept this invite and install Slack on your computer/phone to get notifications and stay up-to-date.</p>

<h2>Google Drive</h2>
<p>Additionally, you will be added to an MICDS MIT Launch Club Google Group. You'll be able to receive club-wide emails and access the shared Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9erU9F8fLaXNVVmYUQ0UzVWYlE?usp=sharing. General information, meeting logs and business ideas are put in this folder for ease of access.</p>

<h1>Leadership Roles</h1>
<p>If you have indicated that you are interested in a leadership position, please contact <strong>Jack Cai (jcai@micds.org)</strong> and <strong>Amir Shinawi (ashinawi@micds.org)</strong> for an short interview. Remember that committing to a leadership position doesn't prevent you from being a part of a company; however, do expect to more time commitment, since you will be helping other startups and leading your own.</p>

<h1>Contact</h1>
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, you can email or Slack messagge club sponsor <strong>Mr. George (dgeorge@micds.org)</strong> or club co-heads <strong>Jack Cai (jcai@micds.org - @jek)</strong> or <strong>Amir Shinawi (ashinawi@micds.org - @captain_amirica)</strong>.</p>
