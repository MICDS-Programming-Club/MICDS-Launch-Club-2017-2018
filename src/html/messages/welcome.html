<p>
	<strong>Hey {{firstName}} {{lastName}}, welcome to the MICDS Entrepreneurship Club!</strong>
	We've got big things planned for this year, so we're glad you're interested!
</p>

<h1 style="color:#d12229">Meeting</h1>
<p>MICDS Entrepreneurship Club will usually meet during collaborative and 8am on Wednesday late starts. Make an effort to attend every meeting, but the extra meeting Wednesday morning is there for people who have to meet with teachers during collaborative.</p>

<h1 style="color:#d12229">Communication</h1>
<p>We will mainly use a messaging platform called Slack to communicate with each other outside of school. <strong>Check your inbox for another email for an invite to our Slack team.</strong> It is important that you accept this invite and install Slack on your computer/phone to get notifications and stay up-to-date.</p>

<h1 style="color:#d12229">Google Drive</h1>
<p>Additionally, you will be invited (soon) to an MICDS Entrepreneurship Club Google Group. You'll be able to receive club-wide emails and access the shared Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9erU9F8fLaXNVVmYUQ0UzVWYlE?usp=sharing. General information, meeting logs, course materials and business ideas are put in this folder for ease of access. If you are wondering about the club, there are plenty of documents in the shared folder that outlines our activities and schedules.</p>

<h1 style="color:#d12229">BLASTOFF event this Saturday</h1>
<p>You are invited to the Entrepreneurship club BLASTOFF this Saturday, from 11:00am to 3:00pm! We will be watching a live webinar aired from MIT, and then engage in an intensive inventathon activity, where you will form teams of 3-5 to brainstorm, prototype and pitch a product to your peers and to MIT. You are encouraged to bring in common household materials to build your product. Lunch (Pizza) will be served as well. For an example of what you should bring and more information, please refer to <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9erU9F8fLaXczBqZUl4Ql9MRjg">this document</a> or contact Jack Cai.</p>

<h1 style="color:#d12229">Leadership Roles</h1>
<p>If you have indicated that you are interested in a leadership position, please contact <strong>Jack Cai (jcai@micds.org)</strong> and <strong>Amir Shinawi (ashinawi@micds.org)</strong> for an short interview. Remember that committing to a leadership position doesn't prevent you from being a part of a company; however, do expect to more time commitment, since you will be helping other startups and leading your own.</p>
