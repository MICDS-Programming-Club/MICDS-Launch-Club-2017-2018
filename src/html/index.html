				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>Launch provides materials and mentorship support to high schools throughout the school year to allow students to develop entrepreneurial skills and mindset by launching startups. This is not a business plan contest. The aim is to create a real startup â€“ to solve a real need in a differentiated way. The focus is on taking action, learning from results, and making changes to improve chances of success. </p>
				<p>Word from the founders: This year is our first year working with MIT to build an entrepreneurial community within MICDS. </p>
