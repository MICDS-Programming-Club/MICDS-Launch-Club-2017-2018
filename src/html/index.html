				<p>Launch provides materials and mentorship support to high schools throughout the school year to allow students to develop entrepreneurial skills and mindset by launching startups. This is not a business plan contest. The aim is to create a real startup â€“ to solve a real need in a differentiated way. The focus is on taking action, learning from results, and making changes to improve chances of success. </p>
				<p>This year is our first year working with MIT to build an entrepreneurial community within MICDS.</p>

				<h1 class="display-3">Club Details</h1>
				<p>The first question the people always have when they are told about MIT Launch is "What do I actually do in the club?" In short, club members will work to deliver a product/service to real-world customers. All members will attend a weekly meeting of roughtly an hour long to study entrepreneurial courses, report their companies' progress and work on their own projects. Below are some documents containing general information about the club.</p>

				<h1 class="display-3">Frequent Questions</h1>
				<h2>Do I need to come in with an idea in mind?</h2>
				<p>You do not need to! During the year-long club program, you will have plenty of time to generate a central mission for you company. This club is for anyone who has an interest for entrepreneurship.</p>
				<h2>How much coding skill is required?</h2>
				<p>No coding skill is required. Instead of thinking about your computer experience, you should focus on the big picture, like the problems and needs in your community. That determines what you need to build as a product. While some people choose to build an app, you can deliver your product in many other ways. If you have any problems with coding or technology, don't hesitate to reach out to your peers and our technology leads.</p>
				<h2>What if I am interested in designing or engineering, but don't want to start a company?</h2>
				<p>You should still join Launch! Company building is a team endeavor, and you can definitely find a team that needs you.</p>
